
Design Plan - P2
Due: 3/12/25 11:59pm

After reading the specs, start populating a list of things you think you might have to do to finish this project
 
 1) read the specs - understand
 2) Understand map-based input files
 
 
 Design Plan:
	---> Make a readMap method where it can take the test-case Maps through a file reader
	---> Use a scanner to see the input within the file
	---> Create a 3D Array with the number of rows, number of columns & the number of maze rooms
	---> Instantiate a two step iteration with the outer loop checking to see if there is another row
	---> The inner loop should be checking to see if the iterator has reached the end of the number of columns yet
	---> While these two conditions are now met, check & store each element at that position in a char
	---> Take each element & store it within the 3D Array created earlier
		---> Store this element at the index for which row we are currently in
		---> Store this element at the index for which column we are currently in
	---> Add a conditional to check if the character at the current location in the map
		 is that of the open walkway (|).
		---> If the current character is that of the open walkway, then update the index for the rows & change the 
		     columns back to the first index (0).
		---> Start the iteration process over again from that row & column row index
	
	Make a Queue Based Approach for this
	 ---> Create an empty Queue object
	 ---> Wherever the start position is, enqueue that position in
	 ---> Dequeue the start position from the queue immediately
	 ---> From the position that was just dequeued, iterate in the directions of North, South, West & East
	 	---> While the iteration is going, enqueue all of the "." tiles along the way
	 --->
