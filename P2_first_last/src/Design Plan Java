
Design Plan - P2
Due: 3/12/25 11:59pm

After reading the specs, start populating a list of things you think you might have to do to finish this project
 
 1) read the specs - understand
 2) Understand map-based input files
 
 
 Design Plan:
 
	---> Make a 3D Array with three dimensions for the map
	---> Set the first dimension to store the number of maps/levels
		---> In this case, there will be 2 level map
	---> Set the second dimension to store the number of rows in each level
		---> In this case, there will be 25 rows
	---> Set the third dimension to store the number of columns in each row
		---> In this case, there will be 50 columns
	
		Queue Based Approach:
			
			---> Set up an empty Queue
			---> Enqueue the coordinate of the start position
			--->
